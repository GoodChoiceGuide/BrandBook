# [The life of an Apple iPhone](http://draftin.com/documents/1670961)
Since Apple [introduced the iPhone in 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o), smartphones have become an [economic and cultural force](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/16/apples-iphone-created-industries-and-changed-the-world-this-decade.html). Apple has since sold over [two billion](https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/22/steve-jobs-legacy-iphone-13/) iPhones worldwide. 

Both [professional reviewers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/07/iphone-13-pro-review-apple-very-best-speed-camera-zoom-battery) and [customers](https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-5g-128gb-gold-verizon/6443336?variant=A&page=1) generally praise the experience of using iPhones. Apple maintains a lot of control over how iPhone parts are made, which gives iPhones a [pleasing consistency](https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/iphone-vs-android).

Yet the sheer amount of iPhones in existence comes with [environmental challenges](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/07/we-cant-do-it-ourselves.html). As the world's [most valuable company](https://www.investopedia.com/biggest-companies-in-the-world-by-market-cap-5212784), environmentalists have hoped Apple would be able to fix some of the issues. Instead, the iPhone has showcased just how [complex these issues can be](https://theconversation.com/apple-the-1-trillion-company-searching-for-its-soul-101030).

## Waste from Apple iPhones
An iPhone might be small - but every iPhone packs a lot of mixed traces of metals in them. The total amounts of metals from iPhone production [has added up](https://www.compareandrecycle.co.uk/blog/are-iphones-bad-for-the-environment) after billions of iPhone devices have been sold. 

### What happens to an iPhone after you send it to e-waste recycling
Sending a broken iPhone to a proper e-waste recycler is important for avoiding the toxic leakage which [normally takes over landfills](https://www.popsci.com/where-do-recycled-electronics-go/). However, iPhone devices are harder to [properly recycle than you would hope](https://www.compareandrecycle.co.uk/blog/are-iphones-bad-for-the-environment).

According to a [Vox report](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/8/16621512/where-does-my-smartphone-iphone-8-x-go-recycling-afterlife-toxic-waste-environment):

- The best iPhone recyclers will first check to see if an iPhone can be fixed and refurbished to sell second hand or donated (hopefully wiping its data first). 
- Reputable recyclers will shred any remaining iPhone devices and [send the remains to registered smelters](https://www.npr.org/2010/12/21/132204954/after-dump-what-happens-to-electronic-waste)
- Less reputable recyclers will send a broken iPhone to a shadowy network of middlemen to scrapyards in countries such as China, India, Ghana and Pakistan.

> The environmental cost of such a transaction is high — but the human cost is higher. Walk the streets of e-graveyards like Agbobloshie in West Africa or similar sites in Asia or another part of the developing world, and you’ll see hundreds, if not thousands, of microentrepreneurs, essentially cooking printed circuit boards to extract the metals within. From experience, I can say that the smell in the air is dizzying, and sticks in your nostrils and throat for days. [- Vox](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/8/16621512/where-does-my-smartphone-iphone-8-x-go-recycling-afterlife-toxic-waste-environment)

#### 'Daisy': the robot who can recycle an iPhone
Apple has worked on its own projects for recycling iPhone devices. A recent innovation has been [buidling a robot named 'Daisy'](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/apple-ups-phone-recycling-with-daisy-robot-but-still-relies-on-mines-20200114-p53r8u.html). Daisy can expertly dissemble an iPhone to extract its materials for reuse. 

While it helps, Apple acknowledges that the increasing demand of minerals will mean that even more mines will need to open around the world in the future.

> "We're not necessarily competing with the folks who mine," said Lisa Jackson, the company's head of environment, policy and social. "There's nothing for miners to fear in this development." [- Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/apple-ups-phone-recycling-with-daisy-robot-but-still-relies-on-mines-20200114-p53r8u.html)

### Most of the environmental damage of an iPhone is done before a customer opens the box
The whole process of making an iPhone [requires a lot of energy](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html) and emits a lot of carbon emissions.

Substantial carbon emissions are made when:
- [mining the materials](https://www.compareandrecycle.co.uk/blog/are-iphones-bad-for-the-environment)
- transporting parts
- running the factories that assemble the parts
- making the huge number of microscopic parts needed in the processor chips (the [processor](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apples-a15-bionic-chip-powers-iphone-13-with-15-billion-transistors-new-graphics-and-ai/) in the iPhone 13 has over *15 billion* transistor parts alone). 

Every new iPhone model Apple design is more powerful than the last. According to **Apple's own environmental modeling** - this directly leads to [Apple's carbon emissions growing every year as well](https://www.compareandrecycle.co.uk/blog/are-iphones-bad-for-the-environment).

### The greenest iPhone is the one you already own
Keeping **each iPhone alive as long as possible** is the [most effective goal you can have](https://www.lifewire.com/can-smartphones-ever-be-ethical-and-sustainable-5085467) for helping its environmental impact. The environmental costs of iPhones would be far less significant if [everyone worked together](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/07/we-cant-do-it-ourselves.html) to regularly keep their phones working for longer. The carbon footprint of a phone is much better if you keep it for [5 years instead of 3](https://thenextweb.com/news/fairphone-sustainable-phone-repair-modules-interview ). However, this mindset contradicts Apple's incentives to [replace iPhones every second year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/16/apples-iphone-created-industries-and-changed-the-world-this-decade.html). 

Studies show that around [half of smartphone users](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/technology/articles-reports/2020/05/07/45-smartphone-owners-would-rather-upgrade-repair) would rather buy a new phone than make a repair.

### How fixable is the iPhone?
The [iFixit website](https://www.ifixit.com/) keeps track of how easy it is to repair different phones. IFixit gave most recent iPhone models [a Repairability Score of 6/10](https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability) - better than a lot of other mainstream smartphone brands. 


### The Right to Repair movement

The [Right to Repair movement](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-store-vs-repair-shop-what-the-right-to-repair-is-all-about/F6C58D65-E0FD-45BA-97C6-01E103203F6D) has gained traction as a global political movement. The USA President, Joe Biden, has [signed an executive order](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/14/tech/right-to-repair-biden-executive-order/index.html) to help devices like iPhones be more fixable in the future.

In 2021, Apple announced that customers will be able to buy iPhone screens and repair guides directly from Apple. Right to Repair groups [hopes that this will be the first step](www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html) in the vision for an open marketplace of repairs.


## What it's like to use an Apple iPhone
Apple has a famous reputation for making the iPhone nicely designed and easy to use. This is considered the [foundation of its profitability](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-apple-products-are-so-expensive-iphone-macbook-2019-11).

### Reviewers tend to love Apple iPhones.
Overall, reviewers praise the iPhone. Recent iPhone models received scores of at least [4 out of 5 stars on PC Mag](
https://www.pcmag.com/categories/mobile-phones/brands/apple) or [8 out of 10 on Wired](https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/).

Overall customer ratings of iPhones are also frequntly [positive](https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-5g-128gb-gold-verizon/6443336?variant=A&page=1).


### The main iPhone features
The iPhone features that reviewers tend to focus on are the:
- **Camera** - the latest iPhones include [multiple high-quality lenses](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-phone-cameras,review-2272.html).
- **Performance** - The Apple iPhone has dedicated chips that [perform well on benchmarking tests](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-12-benchmarks-this-destroys-every-android-phone). Its software and hardware integration also helps apps [perform well in everyday use](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616021952/https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-or-samsung-which-should-you-buy-4684088).
- **Design and experience of its software** - the iPhone works smoothly and is visually appealing.

### Apple focuses on control and consistency
Apple maintains a high level of control and consistency in its phones. The various software and hardware parts [work together harmoniously](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-is-better-than-android,news-21307.html). This helps [with everyday performance](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616021952/https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-or-samsung-which-should-you-buy-4684088) and gives the experience of using an iPhone a [dependable sameness](https://www.choice.com.au/electronics-and-technology/phones/mobile-phones/buying-guides/smartphones).

### The iPhone integrates really well with other Apple devices
in addition to the iPhone, Apple showcases its design strengths with a range of other devices - such as the Apple Watch, iPad and Mac computers. All of these devices are designed to work seamlessly together - a [key benefit of owning an iPhone](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3218067/how-to-switch-from-iphone-to-android-ultimate-guide.html). Things like photos, calendars and emails will 'sync' from an iPhone to other devices via its 'iCloud'. iPhone users even get a [special and exclusive messaging platform](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3646870/android-ios-messaging.html) when just messaging between iPhone to iPhone.

However, these benefits come with [a sting](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-vs-apple-ecosystem-1132801/). If iPhone customers get comfortable having all their information working well in the cloud, they may be reluctant to move to competing smartphones. This strategy has been called [ecosystem lock-in](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-vs-apple-ecosystem-1132801/), although it can be helped by [storing your data in cloud services other than Apple's iCloud](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3218067/how-to-switch-from-iphone-to-android-ultimate-guide.html). 

## What's inside an Apple iPhone

## The life of an Apple iPhone before it reaches you
### Apple's global suppliers
While Apple tightly controls the design of an iPhone, making an iPhone is very much a [team effort](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090315/10-major-companies-tied-apple-supply-chain.asp). There are many small and large companies who make iPhone parts across the globe. Companies compete very hard to [supply parts for Apple](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090315/10-major-companies-tied-apple-supply-chain.asp), and winning Apple contracts can be very prestigious. 

However, actually supplying Apple can be a [blessing and a curse](https://www.ft.com/content/3d49b76a-1b76-11e7-a266-12672483791a). Apple is known for wanting to control the minute details of how its parts are made, as well as driving hard on low costs. Even still, Apple can drop its suppliers abruptly. Companies who make a large portion of its revenue through Apple are considered slightly [riskier on the share market](https://www.ft.com/content/3d49b76a-1b76-11e7-a266-12672483791a).

#### Major legal disputes over the iPhone
Even Apple's biggest and most advanced suppliers experience tense times while working on Apple contracts. 

**Samsung** makes key parts for the iPhone - at the same time as making its own, competing, smartphones. For 7 years [Samsung and Apple sued and counter-sued each other](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510908/apple-samsung-settle-patent-battle-over-copying-iphone) over claims Samsung copied patented features from the iPhone.

**Qualcomm** makes chips and critical networking parts for smartphones. Qualcomm and Apple also got involved in [acrimonious legal battles with each other](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-face-off-epic-courtroom-drama/) for several years, over Qualcomm's pricing strategies. At one stage there were more than 80 lawsuits between each other, spanning several continents. The two companies eventually settled.

#### Assembled at "iPhone City" 
The largest factory which assembles the iPhone is in Zhengzhou, China and is nick-named [iPhone City](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-factory-foxconn-china-photos-tour-2018-5). It has around 350,000 workers - bigger than the entire workforce of many large cities. 

The factory is owned by a company called **Foxconn**. Foxconn is an independent company to Apple, but they are [strategically intertwined](https://www.androidauthority.com/foxconn-apple-electronics-giant-819789/) - Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer, and Foxconn is Apple's biggest assembler. 

### Human rights stories in iPhone factories
Foxconn made global news in 2010 when a cluster of workers [started committing suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract). Stories emerged of factory workers with excessive overtime, harsh management and repetitive work. Foxconn (and Apple) management kicked into gear by starting a range of counselling services to employees, but the world was especially chilled to see large [suicide nets](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/monotony-blamed-for-company-suicides-20110802-1i8yp.html) being installed to catch jumping workers, as one 'fix’.

Foxconn defended itself by saying that it has over a million employees overall and, as a percentage, the amount of suicides at 'iPhone City' was the same as the general rate of suicides in its home country. This was true... Although, statistically speaking, it [*was* unusual](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/foxconns-rise-and-labors-fall-in-global-china/) that suicides came from a mostly young, male, employed workforce. 

Regardless, it did mean Western readers were faced with stories of the people who made their iPhones. In 2012, Foxconn [made the news again](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract) when 150 workers gathered on the roof of the building of Foxconn and threatened to jump, essentially using suicide as a bargaining chip in a workplace dispute (they were promised improvements and talked down by management).

Today, iPhone workers are still widely reported to work long hours, with [one day off a week](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/foxconns-rise-and-labors-fall-in-global-china/) - or one day off a fortnight, if there is a deadline coming up. Apple has implemented restrictions on how much overtime workers in its supply chain should work - which is actually weaker than China's own legal restrictions on overtime. Although none of the overtime restrictions have been found to be [effectively enforced in practice](https://theconversation.com/a-bloody-decade-of-the-iphone-82974). One Non Goverment Organisation [calculated](https://theconversation.com/a-bloody-decade-of-the-iphone-82974) that an iPhone worker in Shenzen, China must work 80-90 hours of overtime every month to make a living wage - more than double the legal cap of 36 hours overtime.

Many empoloyees live in dorms at the factory property - so they live and work in the same place. Western journalists are rarely allowed to see these rooms, but when they do the [pictures of the dorm are bleak](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3582640/Open-sewers-mildewed-walls-one-toilet-FORTY-people-Shocking-pictures-dirty-dormitories-Apple-s-iPhone-workers-live-like-animals.html
). At best, married workers [see their spouses once a week](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-iphone-factory-foxconn-china-photos-tour-2018-5).

Workers report being under stress and belittled, but the culture of the organisation is such that all management acts in this way. “Outside the lab,” according to an [ominous saying of CEO Terry Gou](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/foxconns-rise-and-labors-fall-in-global-china/), “there is no high tech, only implementation of discipline.”

#### What can Apple do about the lives of iPhone factory workers?
Most people can relate to feeling stuck and powerless in their jobs jobs, even when their workplace issues are relatively minor. Workers at factories like Foxconn can feel especially powerless. Like most factories which supply electronics products, [Foxconn doesn't negotiate with its employees on working conditions in meaningful ways](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/foxconns-rise-and-labors-fall-in-global-china/), according to stories available in Western media. Independent trade unions [are forbidden](https://theconversation.com/chinas-growing-labour-movement-offers-hope-for-workers-globally-39921) in China. That's why human rights groups frequently try to [publicly encourage Apple and Foxconn to improve formal industrial relations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-labour-idUSKCN1VU0JR) at Foxconn factories on an issue-to-issue basis. 

Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and makes the most profitable smartphone. Apple does try to enforce policies to keep its suppliers ethical. But ultimately, part of Apple's profitability comes from putting [enormous pressure on low-paying factory workers in Asia](https://theconversation.com/apple-the-1-trillion-company-searching-for-its-soul-101030). 

> "In driving its contractors to produce on a gargantuan scale, and setting precise standards in the most cost-effective way, Apple has remained in the driver’s seat in the context of transnational production." - [American Affairs Journal](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/foxconns-rise-and-labors-fall-in-global-china/)                                            


### Forced labour of a racial minority in Xinjiang has been used to make iPhone parts
Apple was one of the 83 major global brands who were [found to be using forced labour in their products](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-forced-uighur-labor-iphone-factory-2020-3), including in iPhone parts. The China Communist Party has [detained at  least a million people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/02/11/china-uighurs-genocide-xinjiang/) from the Uighur minority in “reeducation camps” without trial since 2017. [Leaked police files](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/85qihtvw6e/the-faces-from-chinas-uyghur-detention-camps) show the pictures of some of the detainees next to their trivial reasons for detention, such as listening to "an illegal lecture” on someone else’s mobile phone six years earlier.

Uighurs inside and outside the camps [have been exploited for cheap labor](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-labor.html). Camp detainees must sometimes ["graduate” from camps to forced labour](https://www.ft.com/content/eb2239aa-fc4f-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521) as a condition of release. 

This is seen as an effort [to eradicate Uighber culture](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21333345/uighurs-china-internment-camps-forced-labor-xinjiang) in the Xinjiang province of China, essentially turning the area into a modern police state.

#### At least 7 iPhone suppliers were found to be using parts from  Xinjiang
Despite Apple initially denying Uighur forced labour were used to make iPhone parts, later investigations [found 7 iPhone suppliers with links to forced labour](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-china-suppliers-uyghur-muslims-forced-labor-report-2021-5). This included Lens Technology, which makes screens for the iPhone and is one of its oldest suppliers.

#### USA has now banned import of any forced labour goods made in Xinjiang, including iPhone parts
Apple, like other American companies, has now cut ties with its Xinjiang suppliers after the [USA banned any parts from that province](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/allies-seek-follow-us-lead-xinjiang-forced-labor-ban-us-official-2022-07-18/), in 2022. Under the law, any goods from the Xinjiang are presumed to be used with forced labour unless proven otherwise, and thus banned. 

Apple [lobbied against these laws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/20/apple-uighur/) before they came into effect.

## The raw materials needed to make an iPhone
Making an iPhone requires significant amounts of minerals. These minerals are mined from across the world, by suppliers which can be hard to track. 

According to [one estimate](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-merchant-iphone-supplychain-20170723-story.html) miners around the world need to "dig, dynamite, chip and process their way through about 75 pounds of rock" to obtain the 100 or so grams of minerals required for just one iPhone.

Even though the sale price of some raw minerals have been soaring due to the increase of technologies like electric cars, [locals near mining areas are not seeing the benefit](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/the-dark-side-of-congos-cobalt-rush). Mining operations around the world can be precarious work and [difficult to investigate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603496-the-one-device).

### Apple has bought carbon-free aluminium to use in the iPhone SE
To help with the environmental impact of metals used in the iPhone, Apple is using its first ['industrial sized batch' of lab-made, carbon-free aluminium](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-buy-first-large-batch-carbon-free-aluminum-iphone-se-2022-03-24/) to use in making the iPhone SE. The aluminium is made by Elysis, a joint venture between two of the world's biggest aluminum suppliers - Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto.

###Conflict materials in the iPhone
Several of the metals mined for electronics such as the iPhone are strongly linked to several African countries, such as the Dominican Republic of Congo. There, metal mining operations [comes with a lot of violence](https://theconversation.com/the-way-that-minerals-are-mined-affects-conflict-in-eastern-congo-120833), as the metals are incredible valuable and worth fighting over by warlords and other bad actors. This works in the same way as the more well-known ["Blood Diamond" trade](https://money.howstuffworks.com/african-diamond-trade2.htm).

####"Artisan miners" (including child labour) used to make the iPhone
The word "Artisan" can be used in a positive sense, such as artisan beer, coffee, or jewelry. But the term [artisan *miners*](https://theconversation.com/the-way-that-minerals-are-mined-affects-conflict-in-eastern-congo-120833) refers to loosely organised groups of people who mine materials by themselves, outside of big mining operations.

Artisan miners tend to be the focus of human rights stories of miners. The work is [precarious](https://theconversation.com/the-way-that-minerals-are-mined-affects-conflict-in-eastern-congo-120833), and their situations are ripe for exploitation. This includes sending children to work as child labour. 

##### Profile of artisan miners in The New Yorker
The New Yorker ran a profile of artisan miles in the Dominancian Republic of the Congo in 2021. It described workers who faced real physical danger every time they started mining, and could easily be abused by police.

In it, the journalist describes meeting Ziri, who says he has been working on the mines his whole life, even from when he was 3 years old. The skyrocketing of price for Cobalt has not helped him get more money for his troubles, or help the villages where he lives. 
> "I asked Ziki what he thought of people who profited from cobalt mining. “I have sadness in my heart when I think of people who buy the minerals,” he said. “They make so much money, and we have to stay like this.” 
>
> When I told him that Americans paid more than a thousand dollars for the latest iPhone, he replied, “It really hurts me to hear that.”
> *-Nicolas Niarchos*, [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/the-dark-side-of-congos-cobalt-rush)

### Apple has implemented strategies for responsible sourcing of minerals.
Apple implements strategies for responsible sourcing of minerals. These tend to get stronger after media stories are shared about the human rights issues in its supply chains. 

[For example:](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/31/the-dark-side-of-congos-cobalt-rush) Apple suspended buying hand-mined cobalt after a 2016 Amnesty Report and follow up Sky news report drew attention to child labour used in iPhone materials. However,  Apple quietly lifted the ban after the media attention died down. 

#### Current weak spots of responsible sourcing policies
While responsible-sourcing policies is an important step which Apple and other brands are taking, [The Conversation has reported](https://theconversation.com/why-responsible-sourcing-of-drc-minerals-has-major-weak-spots-115245) on two current weak spots:
1. Artisan mining currently gives employment to lots of people, including one million Congolese. Policies should try to uplift the artisan miners, rather than working against them. 
2. It is not clear if minerals declared 'conflict free' *are* currently conflict free. More could be done to ensure that label is accurate.

### What can you do to help reduce the amount of mining needed to make iPhone devices?
To stem the tidal wave of new phones constantly been made, you can:
1. Keep using your existing phone even as it gets 'old'.
2. [Fix your iPhone when it breaks](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone) (or send it to a repair shop). 
3. If your iPhone isn't fixable, send it to an e-waste recycler so at least some of the minerals can be extracted (and to avoid toxic waste in landfill).
4. When buying your next phone, consider buying second-hand.
5. If you want to buy a new phone, invest in a phone you intend to keep for as long as possible. 

Doing all this will send the message to phone manufacturers that each phone should be crafted as a long-term, sustainable device - an 'artisan device' in the best sense.
